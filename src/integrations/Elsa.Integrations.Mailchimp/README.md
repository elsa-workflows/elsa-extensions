                activity.ApiKey = "your-mailchimp-api-key";
                activity.ListId = "your-list-id";
                activity.EmailAddress = new Input<string>("subscriber@example.com");
                activity.Status = "subscribed";
                activity.FirstName = "John";
                activity.LastName = "Doe";
            })
            .Then<WriteRawOutput>(activity =>
            {
                activity.Content = new JavaScriptValue<object>("return `Added subscriber: ${addUpdateListMember.updatedMember.emailAddress}`;");
            });
    }
}
```

            .StartWith<CreateCampaign>(activity =>
            {
                activity.ApiKey = "your-mailchimp-api-key";

                activity.ReplyTo = "no-reply@yourcompany.com";
            })
            .Then<WriteRawOutput>(activity =>
            {
